A demo project, showcasing a diagram extraction algorithm. 

## Running and using this demo

- open the project in an IDE (Intellij IDEA)

Some sample Visual Paradigm generated PDFs are located in the `test_files` folder in the content root. 
The program takes and extracts diagrams from all files in this folder, so any new sample VP PDF can be added here. 

Diagrams will be extracted into `extracted_diagrams` folder in the content root.
